I am a Senior Software Engineer in Natural Language Processing group at Samsung Research Institute, Bangalore, India. I am currently working on an NLU engine. Before coming to Samsung, I was a student in the department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Kanpur from where I graduated in 2015 with both Master's and Bachelor's (dual) degree. As a part of my M.Tech thesis where I worked under Dr. Arnab Bhattacharya, I have worked on Databases, where I extended the Skyline Query operation on Databases, for greater speedup and more precise results in a high dimensonal-uncertain data settings. In 2014, I was a visiting researcher at Seidenberg School of Computer Science, Pace University, New York and worked with Dr. Lixin Tao, on studying the tradeoffs and implementing the inclusion of relationship expresssions in knowledge representation graphs (other than the basis heirarchy relation). I have also done a development internship at Microsoft in 2013.

At IIT Kanpur, I have served as a Teaching assistant for 2 courses, namely, Parallel Programming and Introduction to computer Organisation.
